# Debt-Recovery-Threshold

A threshold assignment is when a breaking point needs to be determined in order to decide if a certain treatment is applied to the population or sample. Examples occur in many sectors: in medicine (above a certain temperature you get medicine), education (above a certain test score students get admitted to a special class), finance (above a certain wealth customers get different levels of service), and public sector (below a certain income someone is eligible for housing benefits).

Regression discontnuity is a useful method to use in threshold assignment, to figure out if the special treatment or action taken affects the outcome in a statistically significant way.

In this example, I played bank data analyst to evaluate if a higher-cost debt recovery strategy is wort the extra cost. The dataset used includes information on debtors, including their gender, age, recovery strategy, expected recovery amount and actual recovery amount
